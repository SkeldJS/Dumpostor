# Skeldjs/Dumpostor

Modified version of [Dumpostor](https://github.com/js6pak/Dumpostor) to dump translation keys in a better JSON format.

Used for [SkeldJS'](https://github.com/SkeldJS/SkeldJS) [translations package](https://github.com/SkeldJS/SkeldJS/tree/master/packages/translations), but is free to use for any other purposes.
